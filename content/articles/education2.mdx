Bob Lazar's master's degrees have been a controversial topic, as no hard evidence has ever been found supporting their existence.
Researchers had difficulty agreeing on what Lazar's narrative timeline was and when he went to which institution.
Stanton Friedman believed that Lazar alleged to have finished his master's degree in physics at MIT in 1982.
Some people such as myself have been very skeptical of Friedman's hypothetical timeline
so the first job one must do is to figure out what is the correct order of events in Lazar's story and that can only
be done if all of the evidence is put on the table and considered objectively.

The order of schools is: MIT, Caltech.

The year of graduation for MIT is 1982, and for Caltech 1985, however according to the report Lazar was evasive when supplying the dates.

> Bob told me that he attended Pierce Junior College, California, then the California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech), and California State University at Northridge. A period of employment by Fairchild was followed by a return to Cal Tech.
> He claims to have obtained masterâ€™s degrees in physics (his thesis: Magnetohydrodynamics) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and in electronics from Cal Tech.

The order of schools is: Pierce, Caltech, Northridge, Caltech. (Above text is not a direct quote from Bob Lazar)

The year of graduation for MIT is 1982, however there's clearly a low level of certainty expressed regarding the reliability of the date.

##### 1997 Beyond Roswell

> Tagliani remembered having worked with Lazar at Fairchild Industries in Los Angeles in 1981. Lazar, he recalled, had worked rather crazy shifts in order to meet his attendance requirements at lectures and seminars at Caltech. They had become friends, and Tagliani had no doubts at all about Lazar having studied at Caltech. (Source: [Link](https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781569247815/page/151/mode/2up?q=tagliani))

Lazar attended Caltech in 1981 according to James Tagliani

##### 2019 Dreamland An Autobiography by Bob Lazar

> I originally worked at Fairchild as a technician repairing broken circuit boards, but eventually became a test engineer, and later an engineer designing circuit and logic boards. I loved electronics and I was earning money and going to school at Caltech by this time. I was studying electronics there mainly because the people at Fairchild thought that was the best use of my time.

> ...
>
> And there I was at the age of twenty-three, working as an electronics engineer even though I was stil a few credits shy of actually having a college degree. I wanted more, so in the summer of 1982, I sent a cover letter and resume to Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Bob Lazar was about to get a degree presumably from Caltech in the summer of 1982 and could have obtained it right after the fall term of 1982.

> I'd taken what I thought was a step in the right direction, was grateful to the folks at Meson for sending me to **MIT**

Bob Lazar was sent to MIT by the Meson facility of Los Alamos Labs some time after the summer of 1982.

> If, in january of 1989, I was eager to get back to working in the scientific community after more than four years...
> (Source: [Link](https://archive.org/details/dreamland-an-autobiography-bob-lazar-george-knapp-z-library_202407/page/n17/mode/2up?q=community))

Lazar left the scientific community in (1989 - 4 =) 1985 and did not get any degrees after 1985.


In July 21, 1986 Bob Lazar filed for bankruptcy. In the papers that were filed at court we can see the dates when Lazar took out loans in the 80s.
In 1983 no loans were taken. In 1984 Lazar borrowed $4000 from his mother. In 1985 Lazar borrowed several loans, the earliest with a concrete date was
March 22, 1985 from Los Alamos Bank. MIT spring graduates typically defend their thesis between mid march and early may so Lazar might
have taken this loan right after he returned from Massachusetts. (Source: [Link](https://www.papooselake.org/the-updated-bob-lazar-timeline))

##### To Summarize:
* When Bob Lazar suggested that he went to MIT in 1982 and to Caltech in 1985 it was always in highly questionable circumstances.
* There is plenty of mentions of Bob Lazar going to Caltech between 1981 and 1982.
* In his biography Lazar suggested that LANL sent him to MIT after he was employed there with a possible graduation date of 1985* the earliest.
* The order of institutes that Lazar attended mentioned by him personally was always: Pierce, Northridge, Caltech.

##### It seems to make more sense...
* that Lazar attended the one year engineering graduate program at California Institute of Technology when he lived in California.
* that Lazar continued his electrical engineering education at Caltech instead of switching to physics at MIT.
* that Lazar expanded his knowledge by learning physics after studying electrical engineering rather than the other way around.

Additional Note*: A master's degree program at Caltech was one year long while at MIT it was two years and required a thesis.

We can conclude that as far as Bob Lazar's story is concerned and according to the proof shown above he was attending **Caltech from 1981 to 1982** and **MIT between 1983 and 1985.**
