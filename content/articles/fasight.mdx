In this article I will look at the [remote viewing](https://farsight.org/WhatIsRemoteViewing) data that was obtained by the Farsight Team about Bob Lazar's activities at Area 51/S4 and published in November of 2024.
I will compare the data to the claims of Bob Lazar to see if they match and showcase the best instances when the remote viewers got a clear hit.
This remote viewing used instrument blinding protocol which means that the monitor who oversees the session was aware of the target,
but was distracted by instrumentation while the next part of a session was taking place, which creates a high level of separation between the
viewer, monitor and target. Farsight remote viewers use the [SRV](https://farsight.org/SRV/) protocol.
There were a number of objects, structures and other information that while consistent with Lazar's story nonetheless were never mentioned by him and
therefore I could not match them with anything. These can be viewed in the original video [here](https://www.farsightprime.com/the-mystery-of-bob-lazar).

##### About the Science of Remote Viewing
::Hidden{title="Click here..."}
The subject of remote viewing has been a contentious topic and many practitioners were shunned by a large subset of society for a long time.
Remote viewing is - after all - the controlled exercise of a mental psychic ability that manifests inside someone's mind and never outside of the mind.
Since no individual can see into another person's consciousness psi phenomena is not detectable using instruments or at least it cannot be for the time being.
While such a handicap does not make the use of science impractical for the purposes of validating the phenomena it does however make any proposal to do so
incredibly difficult for any academic to sell. Remote viewing can be easily tested using statistics, however due to its notoriety such experiments were never
done on a meaningful scale using the proper remote viewing protocols. Consequently no one can claim that the phenomena does not exist or that the protocols and practices are not
effective to gather data for that would require a basis from within the studies of the subject matter that has not been done to date by the mainstream of science.

<b>The Farsight Institute</b>

The longest active remote viewing group has been trained by the [Farsight Institute](https://farsight.org) under the tutelage of [Courtney Brown Ph.D.](https://courtneybrown.com) of Emory University.
The Farsight Team publishes their remote viewing data on the video service [Farsight Prime](https://farsightprime.com) where anyone can see their unfiltered recordings of blind remote viewing.
Validating the results of Farsight will remain impossible as long as scientists refuse to do their jobs, however until that happens everyone is free
to make their own judgment based on the data Farsight and other groups produced over the years. While a scientifically acceptable conclusion cannot be
reached without the collaboration of the scientific community; it is important to keep an open mind for we may never know Farsight might be the real Cassandra
of the modern age whose predictions are accurate but never believed by society due to a curse. In their case predictions of the past but still predictions.

<b>Reflections on progress</b>

History is written by the victors and this is just as true in science as it has been anywhere else. Reading a high school history book one might get the impression
that scientific advancement is a smooth sailing ship on the calm seas of linear time, however that is only because those who came with good ideas and good intentions at the wrong
time were often dismissed and forgotten. Instead of a calm sea scientific advancement has been more like a tsunami where the new ideas have fought a battle against the old guard
in a tug of war fought for prominence. Such was the case in the story of the 19th century obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweis who discovered that by doctors washing their hands with a chloride solution
mortality of mothers could be reduced from 10 percent to 2. His reward was ostracization, expulsion, imprisonment and ultimately death for proposing a theory easily verifiable
using the scientific method and statistics. Some research was done to confirm or falsify Semmelweis's results and the data showed that he was wrong even though today
we recognize beyond any and all doubt that he was right. So how could that have happened? In their experiment the researchers did not follow Semmelweis's protocols to the letter and
because only a handful of people went out of their way to verify his theory it was never discovered that their experiment was botched. That is to say that because
Semmelweis was proposing the radical idea that the doctors carried something invisible that could infect a patient the experiments were never done at a meaningful scale where experimental errors
could have been immediately discovered. Ultimately the idea was proven many years later when Louis Pasteur isolated and identified the bacteria responsible for the fever that
was killing female patients.

<b>Conclusion</b>

All the factors that prevented Semmelweis's discovery from coming to light have plagued the research of remote viewing as well and until something like a microscope that can look
into someone's mind is discovered it is unlikely that anything will change. At the same time one should realize that the uninformed and unscientific opinion of any scientist
is just as unreliable as anyone else's, but at the same time can result in millions lives lost if followed without question and so everyone should use their own discernment until a new and less
prejudicial generation of scientists grows up and fixes the errors of the past.

### The Aurora Craft

One of the often overlooked segments of Lazar's story is that he reportedly have heard and saw the rear of a huge bulky craft at Area 51 which his supervisor called Aurora.
The existence of this craft has never been confirmed officially however there were numerous leaks regarding its existence and parameters.
It is supposedly a space craft that could be carried by a larger plane to a high altitude where it would detach and fly on its own.
Journals usually referred to this craft as the Blackstar XOV (experimental orbital vehicle) and while many pictures have been drawn based on
testimony we cannot be absolutely certain what this craft actually looked like.

::Double{leftImage="/images/posts/farsight/azizufo1.png" leftText="RV of a non surface structure by Aziz Brown" leftSource="https://farsight.org/posts/the-mystery-of-bob-lazar" rightImage="/images/posts/farsight/blackstarxov.png" rightText="Blackstar XOV from Aviation Week March 6, 2006" rightSource="https://archive.aviationweek.com/issue/20060306"}
::

One of the first sketches Aziz has drawn was of a non surface structure which looks like an exotic craft. There is clearly a strong resemblance between this craft and the BlackStar XOV.
The fin on the top of the craft is clearly visible on both pictures as are the down slanting parts on the right side which includes the exhaust at the bottom.
On the left we see the separation between the cockpit and the nose and we have some sense that the sides are protruding horizontally while not having any wings.

So that is what Aziz saw, but what did Bob Lazar see?

::Double{leftImage="/images/posts/farsight/aurora-sketch.jpg" leftText="Sketch of craft based on Lazar's drawing" leftSource="https://youtu.be/P1hWtcpSUdw?t=1156" rightImage="/images/posts/farsight/blackstarxov2.png" rightText="Blackstar XOV from Aviation Week March 6, 2006" rightSource="https://archive.aviationweek.com/issue/20060306"}
::

It seems that Lazar saw the craft from the rear while it was on the ground.
We can see the fin on the top and the tail flaps on the sides and even the engine exhausts on his sketch.
We can conclude that there is a strong correlation between Bob's Aurora the Blackstar and Aziz's non surface structure.

### <br />The time when Lazar sees the first UFO fly for the first time

Not every remote viewer managed to focus on the sports model, but some did and were able to draw relatively accurate pictures of the flying saucer.
These pictures were acquired by specifically focusing on the time when Bob Lazar saw his first UFO, however since UFO is an ambiguous
term some remote viewers got a different non surface structure when focusing on the same target.

::Double{leftImage="/images/posts/farsight/sportm1.jpg" leftText="Non surface structure by Intysam" leftSource="https://farsight.org/posts/the-mystery-of-bob-lazar" rightImage="/images/posts/farsight/sportm4.jpg" rightText="3D model of the Sports Model from boblazar.com" rightSource="https://web.archive.org/web/20010405231740/http://www.boblazar.com/protected/archive.htm"}
::

We can see that Intysam's drawing is quite similar to Lazar's description of the Sports Model.
The window-like objects on the top, the disc shape, the propulsion's location at the bottom, the fact that it flies and has subjects inside all match.
Interestingly the energy seems to spread from a circle in the middle of the bottom of the craft which seems to follow the arched waveguides of the body:

::Hidden{title="Sports Model Archway Waveguides"}
![waveguides](/images/posts/farsight/waveguides.jpg)
<em>"The amplifiers pulse sequentially in a counter clockwise direction" - BL; Source: [link](https://boblazar.com/)</em>
::

The inside of the craft is also very similar to what Lazar has described:

::Double{leftImage="/images/posts/farsight/sportm3.jpg" leftText="Non surface structure by Intysam" leftSource="https://farsight.org/posts/the-mystery-of-bob-lazar" rightImage="/images/posts/farsight/sportm2.jpg" rightText="The Sports Model by Bob Lazar" rightSource="https://web.archive.org/web/20210927012823/https://unitednuclear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=86&products_id=1386"}
::

The most striking similarity between Intysam's sketch and Lazar's drawing are the presence of at least two amplifier boxes
which are in the correct place and have the correct shape as well. Needless to say, a remote viewer perceives reality
differently than we can see it so expecting a one to one match is unreasonable. These amplifiers contain tremendous power
so perceiving that as a strong light is probably correct, especially considering that according to Lazar they produce waves from the electromagnetic spectrum.

### Subject A: Bob Lazar

In the tasking written for the remote viewers the alias "[Subject A](/articles/fasight#farsights-remote-viewing-project-the-mystery-of-bob-lazar)" was used to identify Bob Lazar so when they were describing Subject A or the surrounding of Subject A or following Subject A
they were in reality describing and following Bob Lazar.

![lazars](/images/posts/farsight/bobs.jpg)
*Bob Lazar in 1989 and RV of Lazar by Aziz, Intysam and Shantae (Source: [link](https://thelivingmoon.com/41pegasus/12insiders/Bob_Lazar_001.html#Incredible))*

When the remote viewers looked at Subject A, they generally gave the same description of the person.
Subject A is a young, slender male with short dark hair (In Intysam's drawing the hair is hidden under a helmet). While this description could match a lot of individuals the point here
is that the people who did the remote viewing did in fact get matching results so all of them were probably seeing the same target.

### Gravity Amplifier & Emitter

::Double{leftImage="/images/posts/farsight/emitter1.jpg" leftText="Object near Subject A and picture of same object" leftSource="https://farsight.org/posts/the-mystery-of-bob-lazar" rightImage="/images/posts/farsight/emitter2.jpg" rightText="Sketch of the emitter and amplifier box by Lazar" rightSource="https://web.archive.org/web/20210927012823/https://unitednuclear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=86&products_id=1386"}
::

The emitter - amplifier contraption was seen twice by the remote viewers. In the first instance Shantae seen it on a table
where Subject A worked. Secondly Aziz saw a paper that was handed to Subject A by some men in black looking guys. Normally the emitter is on the
bottom while the amplifier box is on the top, because that is how they are installed on the craft, however it is easier to arrange
the parts upside down when they are put on a table. Since the emitter can move on two different axes it is simpler to put the amplifier box
below the emitter. Lazar also confirmed that one of the amplifiers was laying on the table:

> "Q: So now you're in the lab... which is probably what... a couple of tables and ah... L: It was actually fairly large... there was an area back further in the lab where that equipment was on... one of the amplifiers was laying on a table... the reactor was on a separate plate..." - Bob Lazar (Source: [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20010210210616/http://www.boblazar.com/protected/05.htm))

Just like in the craft the reactor did not need to be connected to the amplifier-emitter directly for the system to create gravity. They merely needed to be in the presence of each other to resonate and function properly, which is why the reactor could be placed on a different plate (the reactor is much smaller than the amplifier):

> Barry pointed at the emitter and then at the reactor. "Yet there they are. Can you tell me that they're not there?" "No, I can't," I paused for a few seconds. "Can you tell me how the hell this is possible?" Barry laughed again and slapped the table. "What do you mean, can I tell you? You tell me. That's why you're here, isn't it? - Dreamland: An Autobiography by Bob Lazar (Source: [link](https://youtu.be/wnPlSc-XnUg?t=7624))

### Surroundings of Subject A

::Double{leftImage="/images/posts/farsight/lab2.jpg" leftText="The surroundings of Subject A by Shantae" leftSource="https://farsight.org/posts/the-mystery-of-bob-lazar" rightImage="/images/posts/farsight/lab1.jpg" rightText="Sketch of the Project Galileo lab by Lazar" rightSource="https://web.archive.org/web/20001017162631/http://www.boblazar.com/protected/sketches.htm"}
::

Shantae has drawn a pretty good picture of Lazar's lab. We can see the two main doors leading to the hallway, the two tables
in the middle and even the amplifier on one of them. One noticeable discrepancy between Lazar's description and Shantae's drawing are
the non surface structures which are flying just outside and above the lab. Since Lazar's lab was underground it is unlikely that such craft could have been seen
by him flying, however the 9 hangars with several crafts were right next to his lab, so many were nearby even if they weren't flying.
When someone sees a non surface structure it can usually be inferred safely that such an object is flying, however sometimes that is incorrect
and that is what might have happened in this particular session. Nevertheless the similarities and level of detail are astonishing.

### Antimatter Reactor

::Double{leftImage="/images/posts/farsight/reactor1.jpg" leftText="Lazar being told what to say about his past at S4 by Intysam" leftSource="https://farsight.org/posts/the-mystery-of-bob-lazar" rightImage="/images/posts/farsight/reactor2.jpg" rightText="The reactor and main waveguide according to Lazar" rightSource="https://boblazar.com"}
::

In Focus 2 the remote viewers were looking at [Event X](/articles/fasight#farsights-remote-viewing-project-the-mystery-of-bob-lazar), which was defined as — "Bob Lazar being told what to say about his past at S4".
There have been no statements made by Lazar that confirm that such an event happened, however multiple viewers retrieved corroborating data of it occurring in the past.
If true this would confirm that Lazar became a controlled leaker at some point to disseminate technical information on the specifics of how the craft worked.
In Intysam's drawing we can see three individuals on one side, which we can interpret as giving the information while on the other side we
are seeing the information itself. Intysam herself stated that Lazar was given a small object and that object itself was information and not
just a physical contraption. The object itself which was designated to be Information looked very much like the reactor that Bob Lazar described
minus the main waveguide of the craft. When viewing Event X Aziz described a very similar meeting, however in his case he saw a
paper given to Subject A which showed the [gravity amplifier and emitter](/articles/fasight#gravity-amplifier-emitter) and not the reactor.
Based on the clothing we can assume that Event X took place in December of 1989 at least 6 months after Lazar allegedly left his job:

> BOB LAZAR LEARNED THAT THE POWER SOURCE OF THE CRAFT he worked on is allegedly an “antimatter reactor.”
> “There’s a [hollow] central column that goes right up the center of the disc that’s a wave guide: the gravity wave is channeled through there.
> The bottom of that connects to the antimatter reactor, [which is] a half of a sphere on the floor of the craft.”
> The central column or wave guide extends to the top of the craft and retracts upward to remove the reactor. The reactor itself is about the size of a basketball, Lazar claims. - Alien contact by Timothy Good (Source: [link](https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780688135102/page/180/mode/2up?q=ANTIMATTER+REACTOR))

### The Pit

::Double{leftImage="/images/posts/farsight/pit1.jpg" leftText="Pit and non surface structure by by Shantae" leftSource="https://farsight.org/posts/the-mystery-of-bob-lazar" rightImage="/images/posts/farsight/pit2.jpg" rightText="Anomaly at Papoose Lake discovered by John Lear" rightSource="https://thelivingmoon.com/47john_lear/02files/S4_Papoose_Lake_Hole.html"}
::

According to aviation expert John Lear - based on a Digital Elevation Module published in 1985 created from radar altitudes collected by airplanes - there is a huge hole near Papoose Lake on the same side as Papoose Mountain and the aforementioned S4.
On Shantae's drawing we can see a similar pit and an empty non surface structure possibly flying into or out of the pit. Next to the pit we see that the surface elevation goes down sharply,
which might be the edge of Papoose lake if Lear's anomaly and the pit are the same. On one of Lear's pictures we can also see an
object at the bottom of the hole:

### Conclusion

In the [Mistery of Bob Lazar](https://farsight.org/posts/the-mystery-of-bob-lazar) there's a lot more interesting information to be found. These few pictures are just a subset of a
much larger whole shared above to show that the data gathered does in fact support Bob Lazar's story to the extent remote viewing
can be used as evidence for anything. Anyone reading this must make that determination for themselves.
