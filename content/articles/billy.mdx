The name Bob Lazar conjures up intrigue and mystery in the world of UFO enthusiasts. His claims of reverse engineering alien craft have piqued the interest of many. Notably, Lazar mentioned that the “Sports Model,” a flying saucer he allegedly worked on, bore a striking resemblance to one of the Beamships captured in photographs by Billy Meier. This article delves into the comparison between these two enigmatic objects, shedding light on the information provided by Lazar and Meier.

It’s essential to clarify from the outset that this exercise cannot definitively prove the authenticity of these saucers. On the other hand, it may help us understand why these crafts have been the subject of prolonged fascination and scrutiny.

To begin, let’s examine Bob Lazar’s statements about the Meier craft.

>    Kevin: I was interested in the condition and shape of the disk that he claims he saw up at Area S-4 on the Range.
>
>    Lazar: The condition and shape? The condition seemed new, as I said on the TV program. It seemed almost brand new, like I said, if I know what a new flying saucer looks like. As far as the shape, have you ever seen any of the Billy Meiers photographs?
>
>    Kevin: I’ve seen a couple, yes.
>
>    Lazar: There’s one that it bears a striking resemblance to. It’s one — I coined the term the Sport Model. It doesn’t have any weird protrusions; it’s a slim, thin disk with ridges in it, and it bears an incredible resemblance to that; and I tend to think that it IS that disk.
>
>    Kevin: Approximate dimensions?
>
>    Lazar: Approximately 30–35 feet by 15 feet tall.

>    Caller: You mentioned some stuff on the Billy Meiers case. Have you read any of that information because you had mentioned that you had seen some pictures ?
>
>    Lazar: Yeah, I looked at the, what caught my eye was certainly the — whatever that book’s called — Contact From the Pleiades or something — but it’s essentially a picture book; there’s really no text in it. One of the craft in there looks strikingly similar to the one I call the Sport Model.
>
>    Caller: What did you think of that similarity ? Did that puzzle you ?
>
>    Lazar: Yeah, because originally I had kind of discounted the Billy Meiers stuff, but that craft looks AMAZINGLY like the one that I worked on. And another thing, somewhere in that book they had a picture of a grassy field with three round indents in the ground. Now that would coincide with the three gravity amplifiers in the bottom of the craft and the imprint that they do make, so that kind of makes me believe that that really did occur.

The pivotal point of comparison between the two crafts comes from a 1986 photograph of three indentations in the ground left by the Beamship of Semjase, who allegedly made contact with Billy. These marks corresponded with the three emitter devices Lazar claimed to have discovered on the Sports Model. The emitters, positioned on the craft’s underside, which Lazar compared to microwave horns, were arranged in a triangular pattern. They could emit gravity waves and consequently could interfere with objects with mass, like the Earth’s surface or the grass that grows on it.

United Nuclear Scientific, Lazar’s company, offers a poster detailing the structure of the Sports Model. However, there is some discrepancy in his testimony regarding the craft’s size. On radio, Lazar stated the length as 30 to 35 feet, while in Timothy Good’s book “Alien Contact,” the length was indicated as 40 feet. This disparity likely results from Lazar’s limited direct involvement with the Sports Model, as he had only seen it a few times and had not measured its exact dimensions.

>    Lazar: …what I sometimes call the gravity amplifiers — hang down. These are three of the cylindrical-shaped black objects, two feet in diameter, four feet long, that actually emit gravitational waves from them, like a microwave horn, right? They are positioned directly underneath the larger rectangular gravity amplifiers on the first level and are, in fact, connected to them.

The diameter of each emitter measured 0.6096 meters or roughly 2 feet wide, which is significantly smaller than the width of the pattern left by the Beamship, spanning 2 meters or approximately 6.5 feet. It’s improbable that any Beamship would possess gravity emitters with a 2-meter width, as this would be unnecesary to create a wave pattern that large. The gravity wave emitted from these devices may naturally expand once it departs from the craft’s underside. This is akin to how electromagnetic waves from a “microwave horn” can spread, which is one of the basic functions of a horn.

In contrast, typical radio waves tend to disperse uniformly in all directions. However, the same principle may not hold true for Plane Spiral Orbital Angular Momentum Waves, which have been studied in detail. These waves move in a beam or vortex-like manner, conserving energy in the process, instead of propagating in all directions.

While Bob Lazar frequently drew comparisons between gravity waves and microwaves, he never explicitly stated that these waves possessed angular momentum or produced spiral patterns. Nevertheless, in reference to the Meier photograph featuring the three round indents, he mentioned that they “coincide with the three gravity amplifiers on the bottom of the craft and the imprint they create.” The precise nature of this similarity, whether referring to the number, alignment of the indents, or their potential spiral pattern, remains a subject open for discussion and interpretation.

Considering that the pattern’s diameter does not align with the emitters’ size and due to the unknown shape of the waves produced during descent, our point of comparison shifts to the space between the emitters and the patterns imprinted in the grass. The latter, referring to the width between these patterns, was measured to be between 3.77 meters (12.3 feet) and 4 meters (13 feet).

In contrast, the distance between the emitters on Lazar’s Sports Model constituted approximately one-fourth of the craft’s width. This calculation places the distance between 2.1 meters (about 7 feet) and 2.9 meters (around 9.5 feet). As a result, the disparity between Meier’s Beamship and Lazar’s Sports Model falls within a range of 30% to 90%. In practical terms, this suggests that the gap between the Beamship’s emitters is, on average, 60% more vast compared to the Sports Model’s emitters.

It’s noteworthy to mention that Lazar’s craft supposedly accommodated occupants measuring 1 meter (approximately 3.5 feet) in height, utilizing a door approximately 1.2 meters (roughly 4 feet) in height for access. In contrast, the Beamship appeared to be designed for occupants of regular human height, around 1.7 meters tall. If we consider the Meier craft as being 60% larger than Lazar’s Sports Model, it implies that it could comfortably house beings who are 60% taller than the relatively short aliens that were associated with the Sports Model. Another possibility is that the emmiters were pushed further apart on the Beamship to make way for an entrance hatch in the middle between the landing gears.

It’s worth noting that the Beamship responsible for the three marks, which were subsequently photographed in June 1976, differs from the one that bears a striking resemblance to Lazar’s Sports Model. The latter, in its design, aligns more closely with the type 1 and type 2 Beamships described in Billy Meier’s contact reports. Unlike Lazar’s saucer, these Beamships were not reported to utilize gravity waves for travel according to Meier’s contact reports.

This distinction is critical because it underscores the differences in propulsion methods between Lazar’s Sports Model and the Beamships. As a result, Bob Lazar, had he only seen the pictures in the book “Contact from the Pleiades,” would not have known which specific craft created the triangular indentations that piqued his interest.

The famous spiral marks are said to have been left by a type 3 Beamship capable of dimensional travel, which is characterized by a distinctive headpiece that distinguishes it from earlier craft designs.

In the [54th Contact Report](https://www.futureofmankind.co.uk/Billy_Meier/Contact_Report_054), Semjase reaffirms that gravity possesses an “electromagnetic nature,” a concept that resonates with Bob Lazar’s [statement from 1993](https://youtu.be/bA1TvhJKv8s?t=6300), asserting that gravity is “a component of the electromagnetic spectrum.”

Billy Meier discusses the spiral patterns with Semjase in [Contact Report 61](https://www.futureofmankind.co.uk/Billy_Meier/Contact_Report_061).

> Billy: Good — We have already noticed several times that the grass and bushes, etc. are pressed down anti-clockwise in a spiral inwards to the centre when the landing supports of your and Quetzal’s ship are lowered down. That is not understandable to us, because as I have seen, the plates of the landing supports do not rotate.

> Semjase:

> -149. The round surfaces of the landing supports, like the whole ship, vibrate in a spiral-shaped anti-gravity vibration, which, as you have rightly observed, forms counter-clockwise from the outside to the centre.
>
> -150. The underside of the ship has four such centres, three of which are located in the landing supports, while the fourth forms the centre of the ship in the underside part.

If we assume that the type 3 Beamship employs similar emitters to the Sports Model, we might speculate that these emitters are positioned within the landing gear structure. Combining these two components could offer practical advantages since the emitters would require multidirectional mobility, and this integration could facilitate the rotation or movement of the landing gear itself.

However, it’s important to note that the fourth gravity source, mentioned by Semjase, positioned between the other three is absent in the Sports Model. This fourth emitter could serve a valuable purpose, potentially facilitating the transportation of items in and out of the craft without necessitating landing. It is conceivable that this lower section was utilized as an access point, serving as a door on the type 3 Beamship, as opposed to the side door present on the Sports Model. If so, using a design such as the Sports Model would have been impractical, since the reactor in the middle of the craft would have been in the way of the entrance hatch. Thus, moving the reactor above the ground level and possibly above the craft itself could mitigate such a problem, and perhaps this is the reason why the Type 3 has an unusual crown on the top.

The German term for the landing apparatus used by Billy Meier is “Landestützen,” which appears in four contact reports: 54, 59, 61, and 69. It’s essential to highlight that all of these contact reports are dated to 1976, rather than 1975. Therefore, the landing gear mentioned in these reports is not associated with the type 1 and type 2 Beamships.

Notably, to the best of my knowledge, there is no photographic evidence of any Beamship with its landing gear deployed and visible. While some artistic depictions have showcased these landing gear, it’s intriguing to observe that such imagery predominantly features the type 1 and type 2 Beamships, rather than the type 3, which left behind the semi-famous imprints.

# Conclusion

While it’s undeniable that Bob Lazar’s Sports Model exhibits a striking resemblance to the type 2 Pledian/Plejaren Beamship and shares similarities in propulsion with the type 3 Beamship, there are still notable differences that lead us to conclude they are distinct but conceivably related objects. Notably, the type 3 Beamship is depicted as having the capability of dimensional travel, raising the intriguing possibility that the Sports Model may have originated from an alternate dimension, the future, or perhaps even both.

>    The voice of reason dictates that care should be taken regarding the statements and claims made by Robert Lazar just as with statements and claims made by “Falcon”, the Roswell Incident footage and the like. Many mysteries, particularly those pertaining to American UFO matters, must be viewed with great caution. This applies to purported abductions by UFOs, respectively, extraterrestrials and their brainwashing techniques, as well as alleged animal mutilations by extraterrestrials, etc. etc., which are frequently carried out by certain secret organizations and terrestrial powers of a similar nature and have, truthfully, nothing to do with extraterrestrials.
