Brought is a special problem with regard to UFOs. In the early days, it was mostly people who were trying to outdo each other in their stories of being contactees. They met with aliens, they were taken on trips to the backside of the Moon by aliens, and the next guy would say, "Well, I went to Jupiter," and so forth. This was a limited subgroup of people.

The contactees, as they were called, had their own subculture. One of the people involved with that movement, Gabriel Greene, died in 2001. He even ran for president on a ticket as a UFO contactee.

The problem has gotten much more invidious since then. We now have people ostensibly with credentials who are frauds and who have latched onto pop culture. Two that come to mind are Robert Scott Lazar, supposedly a nuclear physicist with a master's in physics from MIT and a master's in electronics from Caltech, who supposedly worked at Area 51 back-engineering flying saucers. He claimed to have figured out how they work using element 115.

It’s a long, detailed story—you can buy the videos somewhere else, not from me.

I did a lot of checking on Bob. I tried to meet with him twice. I was supposed to on one occasion, but he didn’t show up. I checked at MIT and Caltech—neither one ever heard of him. The response from Bob’s supporters is, "Well, the government wiped his records clean."

I talked to the legal counsel at MIT. There’s no way to do that. I also spoke with the guy who oversees degrees, commencement lists, and that sort of thing—no mention of Lazar. None of the yearbooks show Lazar either.

For a master’s degree, you need a thesis. I talked to the person responsible for those records—no thesis from Lazar. He was asked publicly, "When did you get your master’s from MIT?" His response: "Well, let me see now... I think it was... yeah, probably 1982."

I have friends who went to MIT. I was accepted there myself out of high school but couldn’t afford to attend. Nobody who gets a master’s degree in physics from MIT forgets what year they received it.

He was asked to name some of his professors. His response: "Well, let’s see now..." He named someone—Bill [last name omitted for privacy]—and I checked. Fortunately, it was not a common name. Bill was a physicist, but there was a problem: Bob said this professor would remember him from Caltech. However, this individual had never taught at Caltech—he only taught at Pierce Junior College.

Bob himself had mentioned Pierce to me on the phone. He did go there—that’s in Southern California—but he was attending at the same time he was supposedly at MIT, 2,500 miles east of there. That’s one heck of a commute.

If you can go to MIT, you don’t go to Pierce Junior College.

Beyond that, I checked his high school. He finished in the bottom third of his class. You can’t get into MIT if you’re not in the top 10%, 15%, or 20% of your class. Bottom third? Never.

His element 115 scheme won’t work. It sounds like good science fiction, though.

I also checked with Los Alamos. He is in the phone book there—doesn’t that prove he was a scientist working there? No, it certainly doesn’t. If you look at the phone book page, at the very top, it says this phone book is for employees of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Department of Energy, Kirk-Meyer Corporation, and several other companies.

Right after Bob’s name, it says "Kirk-Meyer." That’s a subcontractor. He worked at the Maison Facility, where you don’t need a clearance. People come in from all over the world—physicists—to do experiments, and he was a technician working there.

The story goes on and on. Beyond that, I get people telling me, "Well, I don’t see why you don’t believe him—he seems so sincere."

Sincerity is not a check on truth.
