    Someone who allegedly left Los Alamos after owing 100's of thousands of dollars to people. Resulting in Bob finally declaring bankruptcy which was finalised 1 year before his S4 story. Here is John Hornes account of the money Bob owed him and how he had to chase Bob for years. John was one of the lucky ones that got his money back. -> https://www.otherhand.org/home-page/area-51-and-other-strange-places/bluefire-main/bluefire/the-bob-lazar-corner/los-alamos-interview/
    Here is a list of Bob's creditors from the Bankruptcy case - including his parents https://i.imgur.com/j83krN7.jpg https://i.imgur.com/3vObXKR.jpg

    A guy that said he was a physicist at LANL, however, people that knew Bob like John Horne, said he was a electronics technician at LANL. Bob told Stanton Friedman that he went to Pierce College. Bob's 1980 marriage cert lists him as being a electronic engineer. In 1981 Bob was working at Fairchild/Xincom as a electronics test technician according to a work colleague. Bob also admitted working at Fairchild in a Wired article. In 1982 he shows up in LANL and told a reporter who wrote about his jetcar that he was a physicist. In 1989 he used the LANL phone dir to prove he worked there and in combination with the 1982 article used it all as proof he was a physicist there. Problem is, the LANL phone dir lists him working for a company called Kirk Mayer. Kirk Mayer hired tech related roles like electronics technicians. They were formerly called Role-Tec. Bob on Billy Goodman back in 1989 said he started at LANL as a technician. He also told Corbell that in 1982 while working at LANL, that he went out and installed a Sat dish there. This is the year he told the jetcar article journo that he was a physicist there.
    ..
    Recently, someone was able to interview a physicist and building administrator who both worked in the area Bob had worked at in LANL during the same time. Both claim that Bob was a technician at LANL.

    The wired article is about the Gun and firework show Bob ran in the desert called Desert Blast from 87 to 99. Here is a video of Desert Blast 12, Bob the organiser can be seen at :50 in. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZsFVp-yY6M. From memory, Bob learnt to make fireworks from an Italian family he met that made them through generations. Part of his business at United Nuclear is selling fireworks material which he has been busted on several times.https://www.justice.gov/civil/cpb/case/us-v-united-nuclear-scientific-supplies-et-al-0

    Who then got caught and arrested for pandering just months after claiming to be at S4. He claimed he only installed a computer system there despite pleading guilty. But the police Affidavit shows they found the brothel Apt lease agreement with Bob's name on it, Also a hooker said Bob had interviewed her. He also installed surveilance cams in the trick rooms.

    A guy who tells a crowd at Rachel in 1993 that he had professors Duxler and Hohsfield at MIT and Caltech. Duxler was not found there by Friedman when he inquired. There was a Hohsfield and Duxler who were found to be Bob's Highschool and Pierce College teachers for which there is record of Bob attending. MIT and Caltech also told Friedman that Bob had not attended either school.

    A guy who seems to have copied:
    - the Demon core story including the reactor design. The Demon Core story is a true story about a scientist who died opening&closing a reactor. Bob had claimed that he replaced a scientist at S4 who died trying to open the alien reactor. Demon Core -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core#/media/File:Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg
    Bobs Alien Reactor Model - > https://www.gravitywarpdrive.com/Bob_Lazar_S4_Disc_Images/S4_Disc_Reactor_5.gif
    - the E115 story from the Scientific American article that came out just 2 weeks prior.
    - Billy Meiers saucer
    - Reticuli alien origin from Betty and Barny.
    - And finally the story of the gov having acquired a number of UFO's , one of which they could fly - from John Lear who told that story to Knapp 2 years before Bob came out with his S4 story. See Lear telling Knapp the story in 1987 for yourself -> https://youtu.be/LGQkkHuwm6w?t=268.
    Both Gene Huff and John Lear have told the story about how they all met. Their story goes that Bob and Gene Huff met Lear (before Bob's S4 story) and they obtained Lear's UFO files including the Billy Meiers tapes in exchange for a house appraisal. -> https://youtu.be/QRcOWeacG_s?t=366
    Here's a cut clip of Lear saying he showed Lazar the Meiers tape and Bob saying the UFO was like Meiers saucer -> https://twitter.com/ddeanjohnson/status/1361674742030336003. Meiers was later busted when pics he said were of alien women, turned out to be screen grabs from a Dean Martin TV special.
    When Bob gave his first brief interview in silhouette under the alias "Dennis" , that was filmed in a news van parked in John Lears driveway. See for yourself -> https://youtu.be/HyUlaZR0PoY?t=1549

    A guy that allegedly faked a W2. The W2 Bob showed had a Employer that did not exist. It noted the Department of Naval Intelligence rather than the Office of Naval Intelligence.
    See here: https://i.imgur.com/C1ArGTR.jpg
    ..
    The W2 was also typed and not printed - a huge red flag.
    It also had a bogus MAJ OMB number typed in when a legitimate OMB # was already there and printed.
    I could be wrong , but I think you can only have one OMB # in the OMB field, it simply designates what the form is and it's controls
    The 1545-0008 number is correct and designates it as a W2 form - this can be verified in an OMB DB search. https://imgur.com/a/7shXO9R. Nothing comes up for the MAJ #

    Here is what the Pandering Case parole Officer said about Bob's education and employment claims: https://i.imgur.com/uVTGgHI.png

    A guy who took Biglelow night UFO spotting in 1990 near the same spot he took others previously, Bigelow heard a rustle and spotted Lazar letting loose a helium filled mylar balloon towards Papoose. Big's told Rogan this
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUYhCmfE1a0
    Bigelow also setup a company for Lazar to do research. Bigelow fired Lazar when he found Lazar was just using the lab to store furniture. Bigelow also said Lazar made claims about a material that didn't check out -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOGHrxysBKI
    According to Bob's court docs, Bigelow had paid him $2500/month -> https://i.imgur.com/HepKKzm.jpg
    Company Bigelow started with Lazar -> https://i.imgur.com/P5cYqhH.jpg
    ..
    Of course unbelievably, Bigelow still believed Lazar after all that
    ..
    Interestingly, Bigelow's ZetaReticuli 2 lab was incorporated with Bob Lazar listed , around that time he was running a brothel for which he was arrested for.
    ..
    Also noteworthy is that George Knapp never mentioned during that interview that he(George Knapp) worked for Bigelow for several years in the late 90's to early 2000's for NIDS.
    ..
    BTW, Janet flights came into A51 over Papoose ~ twice a night according to Glenn Campbell - their landing lights shone at the Rachel area, A51 also conducted tests of their aircraft in that area. They even let flares loose under balloons for reasons unknown.
    Glenn Campbell wrote a 115 page A51 viewers guide about all this etc -> https://www.amazon.com/Area-Viewers-Guide-Glenn-Campbell/dp/B0006QZTYK
    Hear Lazar say some of this himself -> https://youtu.be/bA1TvhJKv8s?t=3478
    Basically there were lights in the sky over those ranges for one reason or other

    - Allegedly made money from his Autobiograpjhy book called Dreamland
    - Sold merch since day one inc E115 mugs , t-shirts etc.
    - etc etc

    He also started his own UFO radio show called UFO Line - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6PM0Tq0L0c

    A guy that says he flew into A51 and even ate at the canteen their once. Fruehauf, says someone told him recently that they saw Lazar there. But according to the president of the Area 51 veterans T.D Barnes, he had asked security guards and others who worked there at the time, and they all said Bob was never there
    See here -> https://youtu.be/eYttYPb651Q?t=1370
    ..
    Chris Mellon had quoted Eric Davis recently, although he got one detail wrong. Eric said Bob was offsite checking radiation badges, and NOT at A51.
    See Eric's comment re: Lazar -> https://www.ufojoe.net/bob-lazar
    ..
    Here is my interview with Fred Dunham who worked as a security guard at A51 during Bob's supposed time . Bob had claimed he flew there before taking a bus to an S4 at Papoose.
    Fred says Bob was not at A51, he had checked the manifest. Fred had also been to Papoose, no secret base there. And the only road to Papoose was a rough as guts dirt road that a bus could not get down
    See Fred Dunham interview here: https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/ok1xfu/interview_with_area_51_security_guard_fred_dunham/

    A guy who said he used a mysterious hand bone scanner. Not only was the Identimat 2000 in "Close Encounter of the Third Kind" which came out in 1977. It was also in a ton of newspaper and magazine articles going back to 1969. It was used in all kinds of places including universities.
    Here is an article about it from 1972 -> https://i.imgur.com/20kYen8.jpg
    ..
    It was also rumored that Bobs friend Jim Tagliani had worked at Tonopah Test Range, where they did use the Identimat 2000. TTR also had a Site 4 which was a radar facility they used to test the radar signatures of craft being tested there and A51.
    Did Bob get both the Bone scanner and S4 idea from Jim Tagliani?
    ..
    Here is Site-4 at TTR , see bottom right -> https://i.imgur.com/5nrErZL.jpg

    A guy who George Knapp claimed passed a number of Polygraph tests.
    According to Knapps own reports from back in the day, Bob did two Polygraph exams:
    ..
    A) The first was done by Polygrapher Ron Slay. The report by Knapp stated that Bob failed a set of questions and passed another set. Ron then ruled the Polygraph -> Inconclusive
    b) The second Polygraph test was done by Terry Tavernetti ~ a month later, he asked Bob 4 sets of questions. Bob failed the first set of questions. According to Terry , Bob seemed to pass the next three sets of questions. He was going to say Bob passed, but instead decided to consult with two other Polygrapher colleagues. One agreed with Terry, and the other thought Bob was retelling a story he learnt by heart. So at the time, Terry decided not to give any statement of truthfullness
    See original report here - https://imgur.com/a/Fm9qIAM
    Tavernetti saying he failed the first set of questions -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCmQWQxQf4
    ..

    Additional bits:
    a) Knapp claims Bob had a piece of E115 in front of a home made particle accelerator. He was going to flip the switch if the gov came for him and the explosion would have left a great big hole in Vegas. Did Knapp report it to police, how about even a news story about it on KLAS.?
    ..
    b) Knapp had claimed for many years that he knew were some E115 is buried. And as of a few years ago, so has Corbell. Yet despite advocating for disclosure, they wont dig some up and send a grain in anonymously to be analysed to help all of human kind. As Bob hasn't either
    ..
    c) Knapp claims he saw a video of an experiment where some light was shone over some E115 and the light bent. Unfortunately Corbell says when he looked for the complete tape, but Bob had taped over it with an episode of the Golden girls. He only managed to find a short clip that showed nothing happening. Knapp also said he had a copy of the tape, but lost it.
    Bob claimed to have some E115 for 30 years - so why doesn't he repeat the experiment?
    ..
    d) Bob claims 22 people in all were at S4 researching all aspects of the 9 saucers. Only 2 , Barry - fulltime, and Bob - part time were assigned to reverse engineer the gravity drives. This would have been the greatest discovery of all time. Yet despite the gov putting 130,000 people on the A-Bomb, they decided to put one guy named Barry and a part timer named Bob on reverse engineering the saucer gravity drive. As Stanton Friedman said in regards to this, "the gov would have put more people on developing a new mouse trap"
    ..
    Bob also claimed he was told Russian scientists were at "S4". This is interesting, as Bob said to get to "S4" you needed to fly into Area 51 first before busing to "S4". The problem here is that A51 was a top secret base where they flew secret aircraft etc. They primarily kept it secret from .... the Russians. Are we to believe Russian scientists flew into a base the US kept top secret from the Russians.
